## Proposal: Housing and Income Data for Targeted Financial Products and Housing Policy

In many cases, the most useful insights are obtained from a comprehensive analysis of information that might seem disparate. Drawing from a range of data sets, both cleaned and those that would need some scraping and scrubbing, my proposed project would look at the relationship between housing prices and income and a combination of other demographic information. By combining data sets and employing an ensemble machine learning model(clustering and random forest) for analysis, it should be possible to discern the specific factors the relate housing prices and other trends such as probability to buy or rent and demographic information.

The aim of the analysis would be two-fold. On the one hand, using the model, companies such as banks would be able to design targeted poducts that would cater to specific demographics with the aim of getting them to buy more houses. On the other hand, government departments would be able to use the results to better tailor their policies as far as assigning affordable houses or approving new projects for housing.

The notebook wil be used for analyses.
